## üìö Project Description

This project is a Full-Stack Employee Management System built using React.js for the frontend and Java (Spring Boot) for the backend.
It demonstrates a complete implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query, Vite

Backend: Java, Spring Boot (RESTful API)

Other Tools: Axios, Toast Notifications, React Hook Form, Amplitude Analytics Integration

##  Key Features

  Frontend (React.js):

1. Fetch and display all employees from the backend.

2. Add a new employee using a form.

3. Edit existing employee details.

4. Delete an employee with confirmation.

5. Seamless integration with REST API endpoints.

6. Real-time UI feedback with loading states and toast notifications.

7. Event tracking integrated with Amplitude for monitoring user interactions.

  Backend (Java Spring Boot):

1. RESTful API exposing endpoints for all employee operations:

2. GET /employees ‚Äî Get all employees

3. GET /employees/{id} ‚Äî Get a specific employee by ID

4. POST /employees ‚Äî Add a new employee

5. PUT /employees/{id} ‚Äî Update an existing employee

6. DELETE /employees/{id} ‚Äî Delete an employee

  Database: MySQL

  CORS configured to allow frontend-backend communication.

## üöÄ Project Concept

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a full end-to-end CRUD application setup, where:

The React.js frontend interacts with the Java backend through REST API endpoints.

All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are fully functional and dynamically reflected on the UI.

It serves as a strong foundation for understanding full-stack architecture, API consumption, UI state management, and production-ready deployment practices.

## üî• Deployment

Frontend is designed to be deployed on Vercel.

Backend can be deployed separately on platforms like Railway, Render, AWS, or Heroku.

Environment variables are used for dynamic API URLs and keys.
